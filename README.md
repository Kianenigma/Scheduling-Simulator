# Scheduling-Simulator
An html based simulator showing LIFO - FIFO - SJF and RR Algorithms 

# How does it work ? 
Just add a bunch of tasks with specific duration and arrival time and hit start 1 

# Why is the code in just one file ? 
Don't know , i like it dirty baby . 

# Another cleaner example ?
